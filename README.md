## 🌊 AI-Driven Coastal Security Defense System

This project simulates an AI-powered system for coastal security, combining:  
- 🚢 **Threat Detection** → Vessel anomalies from movement patterns  
- 🚁 **Target Precision** → Drone surveillance with object classification  
- 🛰️ **Autonomous Surveillance** → AI-driven detection and tracking  
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity Defense** → Network intrusion detection using log data  

We aim to demonstrate how machine learning models can enhance real-world defense operations, even using simulated or synthetic datasets.
