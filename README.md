# AI-Driven Coastal Security Defense System

This project simulates an AI-powered system for coastal security, combining:
- Threat detection (vessel anomalies)
- Target precision (drone surveillance)
- Autonomous surveillance (AI-driven detection)
- Cybersecurity defense (network intrusion detection)

We aim to demonstrate how machine learning models can enhance real-world defense operations, even using simulated or synthetic datasets.
