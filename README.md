## 🌊 AI-Driven Coastal Security Defense System

This project simulates an AI-powered system for coastal security, combining:  
- 🚢 **Threat Detection** → Vessel anomaly detection from simulated AIS records  
- 🚁 **Target Precision** → Drone surveillance with synthetic image object-classification  
- 🛰️ **Autonomous Tracking** → AI-driven object detection and tracking loops  
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity Defense** → Network intrusion detection on dummy log data  

We demonstrate how machine learning models can enhance real-world defense operations using synthetic datasets.
